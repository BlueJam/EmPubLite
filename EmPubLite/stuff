• Go to the directory where you installed the Android SDK
• In there, go into platforms/
• In there, choose an API level (as icons may look different in Android from
OS version to version)
• In there, go into data/res/
• In there, look at the various drawable- directories, such as drawable-hdpi/

From the Eclipse main menu, choose File > New > Other > Android. In the resulting
dialog, choose “Android Icon Set” and press Next.

The class name of a widget or container — such as RelativeLayout or TextView –
forms the name of the XML element.

2. You can provide wrap_content, which means the widget should take up as
much room as its contents require (e.g., a TextView label widget’s content is
the text to be displayed)
3. You can provide match_parent, which means the widget should fill up all
remaining available space in its enclosing container

Button is a subclass of
TextView

<Button
android:onClick="someMethod"
...
/>
This is enough for Android to “wire together” the Button with the click handler.
When the user clicks the button, someMethod() will be called.

Check all of the properties for the Widgets!!!

The “Request Focus” item in the context menu (right-click over the EditText widget)

The “Hint” item in the Properties pane allows you to set a “hint” for this EditText.
The “hint” text will be shown in light gray in the EditText widget when the user has
not entered anything yet.

Some additional attributes on View most likely to be used include:
1. android:visibility, which controls whether the widget is initially visible
2. android:nextFocusDown, android:nextFocusLeft,
android:nextFocusRight, and android:nextFocusUp, which control the
focus order if the user uses the D-pad, trackball, or similar pointing device

You can give a widget focus via requestFocus() and see if it is focused via
isFocused()

Sometimes, the R values get out of sync with precompiled classes from previous builds. To resolve this, you need to clean your project. In Eclipse, this is a matter of
selecting the project, then choosing Project > Clean

The orientation can be modified at runtime by invoking setOrientation() on the
LinearLayout, supplying it either HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL.

1. isChecked() to determine if the checkbox has been checked
2. setChecked() to force the checkbox into a checked or unchecked state
3. toggle() to toggle the checkbox as if the user clicked upon it
cb.setOnCheckedChangeListener(this)
onCheckedChanged()

android:textColor="#11ff00"

int x = Integer.parseInt(editText1.getText().toString());

CheckBox, ToggleButton, and RadioButton all inherit from CompoundButton, which
in turn inherits from TextView. Hence, all the standard TextView properties for font
face, style, color, etc. are available for controlling the look of radio buttons. Similarly,
you can call isChecked() on a RadioButton to see if it is selected, toggle() to
change its checked state, and so on, like you can with a CheckBox.

android:layout_alignBaseline indicates that the baselines of the two
widgets should be aligned (where the “baseline” is that invisible line that text
appears to sit on)

android:layout_toRightOf = "@id/widget_a"

First, you will need to call setChoiceMode() on the ListView in Java code to set the
choice mode, supplying either CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE or CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE as the
value. You can get your ListView from a ListActivity via getListView().
android.R.layout.simple_list_item_single_choice or
android.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice for single-choice or
multiple-choice lists, respectively.

String[] items={"this", "is", "a", "really", "silly", "list"};
new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, items);

Accessing a ListView, not like v this, but like vv this.
displayResults = (Button)findViewById(R.id.displayresults);
listView = getListView();

browser = (WebView)findViewById(R.id.webkit);
browser.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
browser.loadUrl("http://www.google.co.uk");

Instead of loadUrl(), you can also use loadData(). Here, you supply the HTML for
the WebView to display.

When styling a widget or container, you can apply any of that widget’s or container’s
attributes in the style itself. So, if it shows up in the “XML Attributes” or “Inherited
XML Attributes” portions of the Android JavaDocs, you can put it in a style.
Also, layout directives, such as android:layout_width, can be put in a style.

Themes are styles, applied to an activity or application, via an android:theme
attribute on the <activity> or <application> element

An Android library project is a special type of Android project designed to share
code and resources between Android application projects. It is specifically aimed at
developers or teams creating multiple applications from the same code base. The
original occurrence of this pattern is the “paid/free” application pair

The biggest difference between an Android library project and a JAR is that an
Android library project is designed to distribute resources as well as Java code. If all
you are looking to distribute is Java code, a JAR works just as well as an Android
library project. But if you need to distribute layouts, themes, and the like, an
Android library project is the solution.

If you want an activity stack that is B-C-A — so the existing copy of A is brought to
the foreground, but the instances of B and C are left alone — then you can add
FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT to your Intent used with startActivity():
Intent i=new Intent(this, HomeActivity.class);
i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT);
startActivity(i);

If, instead, you want an activity stack that is just A — so if the user presses BACK,
they exit your application — then you would add two flags:
FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP and FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP:
Intent i=new Intent(this, HomeActivity.class);
i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP);
startActivity(i);
This will finish all activities in the stack between the current activity and the one
you are starting — in our case, finishing C and B.
